# Overview

## What is this project?

The goal of this project is to collaborate with your Collab Lab team to create a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you‚Äôre likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

## How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., ‚ÄúGreek yogurt‚Äù or ‚ÄúPaper towels‚Äù) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.

# Project setup

## Download Node and NPM

* `npm` is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get `npm` installed on your computer.
* Follow the [instructions here to install Node.js and `npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Clone project locally

* On GitHub, navigate to the repo for your cohort‚Äôs project (you‚Äôre probably there right now, click the "Code" tab at the top).
  
* Click the green "Clone or download" button and copy the web URL.

* From your terminal, `cd` into the directory where you want this project to live.

* Once you‚Äôre in the directory, type `git clone` followed by the web URL you just copied to your clipboard from GitHub.

* Then navigate into the project by typing `cd` followed by the project directory‚Äôs name.


## Update dependencies

* Once you have the project locally and you are in the project directory, you‚Äôll want to update all the project‚Äôs dependencies. To do so, type the following into your terminal: `npm update`

* Maybe take a sip of coffee or check in on Twitter, this could take a minute -- don‚Äôt worry.

## Access the project in your browser

* After you‚Äôve cloned the project locally and updated the dependencies, run the project by typing the following into your terminal: `npm start`. You should be able to see the project at `localhost:3000`.

# Boilerplate information

Everything in this section is automatically generated when you create a new app using `create-react-app`. These details can be really helpful in learning how to launch and manage your React app with `npm`.

## ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì create-react-app boilerplate ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More
